Python Data Analysis Project

Introduction

This project has been developed as part of the Python for Data Analysis course. The main objective of this project is to perform various tasks related to data analysis of cryptocurrency quotes using Python. The following tasks are covered in this project:

- Reading and Representation of Currency Pair Movement
- Data download using the Kraken library.
- Price charting.
- User input for charting a selected quote.
- Calculation of the moving average and chart.
- Calculation of the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and chart.
- Charting of the moving average alongside the corresponding quote.

The project's code is logically and modularly structured. Each task has been addressed in separate modules, facilitating code comprehension and reuse.

Application to Bitcoin
This project can be applied to other cryptocurrencies in addition to ETH/USD. In the future, adaptations can be made to analyze data related to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.
